# Objective

> Detection of Zilla Parishad(ZP) School(s) from Satellite basemap imagery

## Highlights

- Uses Mapbox Satellite Basemap as input for prediction
- Filters built-up area alone using NICFI Planetscope data
- Label images without the need of georeferencing
- UNET model uses lesser training labels - in tens to few hundreds

RS Imagery can be used for multiple applications amongst which building and road detection are common. But School detection is one of the complex problems that needs to be addressed given the variety of features they cover. This repository marks the begining of the school detection project in this direction. Codebase can be found [here](https://github.com/geospoc/unc-sch-01).
