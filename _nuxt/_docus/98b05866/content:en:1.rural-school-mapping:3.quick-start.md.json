The csv file contains necessary Latitude and Longitude.

Corresponding codebase can be found [here.](https://github.com/geospoc/unc-gis-planet-download)\n\n## Saliency Maps\n\n<p>It is important to visualise the model at each filter inorder to understand what the model is looking at. Saliency maps are used for this purpose.
