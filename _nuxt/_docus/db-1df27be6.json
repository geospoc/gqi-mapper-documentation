MOBAC generated mapbox mosaic as inputs but of lower image quality consequently garbage predictions obtained.\n\nMaking use of Mapbox tiles instead of MOBAC generated mosaic due to increased data visual quality\n\nInclude rural school POIs with large footprint and ignore outliers like small ones and those that are irregularly shaped.\n\n<p>Detection of Building edges not pronounced. Received feedback from the data science team to include building edges in training. But did not serve the purpose as it was not a whole entity.</p>\n\n29th October Building edges are sharp, school based features have diminished. Our next effort would be to train urban POIs of increased data quality eg. Chennai, Kerala\n\nImproved detections from model weights containing Chennai, Kerala pois\n\nData Fusion to overcome old satellite basemaps in rural areas. Use of Planetscope data from NICFI programme along with Worldview-4 or Mapbox satellite basemap\n\nImage distortion due to use of nonstandardized DNs. Figured fix to remove distortion using reflectance data\n\nObtain predictions for two districts and create confusion matrix. Satisfactory predictions obtained.\n","empty":false,"createdAt":"2021-06-25T20:40:53.557Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-25T20:40:53.557Z","source":"en/6.project-trials.md","key":"en/6.project-trials.md","layout":{},"position":"000600000000","to":"/project-trials","language":"en","draft":false,"meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1624653739371},"$loki":7},{"path":"/data/docus/navigation/en","dir":"/docus/navigation","slug":"en","extension":".json","body":[{"slug":"","to":"/","page":true,"children":[],"title":"Introduction"},{"slug":"about","to":"/about","page":true,"children":[],"title":"What's this about?"},{"slug":"objective","to":"/objective","page":true,"children":[],"title":"Objective"},{"slug":"quick-start","to":"/quick-start","page":true,"children":[],"title":"Development Quickstart Guide"},{"slug":"results-portal","to":"/results-portal","page":true,"children":[],"title":"Rural Schools Portal"},{"slug":"project-trials","to":"/project-trials","page":true,"children":[],"title":"Project trials"}],"source":"docus:navigation:en.json","key":"docus:navigation:en.json","layout":{},"meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1624653739372},"$loki":8}],"idIndex":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],"maxId":8,"_dirty":true,"_nestedProperties":[],"transactional":false,"asyncListeners":false,"disableMeta":false,"disableChangesApi":true,"disableDeltaChangesApi":true,"cloneObjects":false,"cloneMethod":"deep","changes":[],"_fullTextSearch":null}],"databaseVersion":1.5,"engineVersion":1.5,"filename":"docus.db","_persistenceAdapter":null,"_persistenceMethod":null,"_throttledSaves":true}
